Analysis of Baron scRNAseq data set for Weill Cornell Functional Interpretation of High-Throughput Data

Baron et al. (Cell Syst. 3 (4):346–60) performed droplet-based single cell experiments of pancreatic cells from four human donors and two mice. Using this data, they identify the primary cellular composition of the pancreas including endocrine cells (alpha, beta,…), acinar, ductal, endothelial, and immune cells.

The assignment for Functional Interpretation of High Throughput Data course is to perform single-cell analysis of this data towards identifying the cell composition of the human pancreas. The end goal is to generate an annotated plot of cellular composition. Through the analysis, you will get familiarized with scRNA data, common data structures used in this analysis, various algorithms and visualization approaches.
